# Overview

My main work is found in the 'mysite' folder, I only have one webpage that displays right now, but I have lots more webpages that I've made and are ready to display.

Anything in the 'repel-samples' folder was not written by me. Everything in that folder was created by someone else and it's here only as a reference example of how to use the Django script. I will delete the repl-samples folder when I don't need to use them as a reference anymore.

The 'Project1' folder is where did most of my experiments and is my 'hello world' project.

The 'My_website' folder is where I'm storing all of my webpages for now, none of them will display through Django right now. In this folder are fully realized CSS and HTML templates. I also have some front-end JavaScript apps and I will implement them soon.

# Web Pages

I deleted a lot of stuff and I am resolved to begin again from scratch. I had some webpages, but I wasn't satisfied with how little I knew how to use Djano

# Development Environment

I'm using mostly Visual Studio Code and the Cromium Brave web browser.
